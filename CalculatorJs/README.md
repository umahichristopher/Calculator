## How It Works

The calculator uses JavaScript to handle button clicks and perform calculations. It keeps track of the first value, second value, selected operation, and result. When you click an operation button, it stores the first value and the operation. When you click a number button, it appends that number to either the first or second value, depending on whether an operation has been selected. When you click the equals button, it calculates the result based on the stored values and operation.
